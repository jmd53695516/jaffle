# ðŸ¥ª The Jaffle Shop ðŸ¦˜

This is a sandbox project for exploring the basic functionality and latest features of dbt. It's based on a fictional restaurant called the Jaffle Shop that serves [jaffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_iron). Enjoy!

## Create new repo from template

2. Follow the steps to create a new repository.

## Platform setup

### dbt Cloud IDE (most beginner friendly)

1. Set up a dbt Cloud account and follow Step 4 in the [Quickstart instructions for your data platform](https://docs.getdbt.com/quickstarts), to connect your platform to dbt Cloud.

2. Choose the repo you created in Step 1 as the repository for your dbt Project code.

3. Click `Develop` in the top nav, you should be prompted to run a `dbt deps`, which you should do.

### dbt Cloud CLI (if you prefer to work locally)

> If you'd like to use the dbt Cloud CLI, but are a little intimidated by the terminal, we've included a task runner called, fittingly, `task`. It's a simple way to run the commands you need to get started with dbt. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation). We'll call out the `task` based alternative to each command below.

1. Run `git clone [new repo name]` to clone your new repo to your local machine.

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it. I like to call my virtual environment `.venv` and add it to my `.gitignore` file (we've already done this if you name your virtual environment '.venv') so that I don't accidentally commit it to the repository, but you can call it whatever you want.

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv .venv # create a virtual environment
   OR
   task venv # create a virtual environment

   source .venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
   ```

3. Install the project's requirements into your virtual environment.

   ```shell
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt # install the project's requirements
   OR
   task install # install the project's requirements
   ```

4. [Follow steps 2 and 3 on this page](https://cloud.getdbt.com/cloud-cli) to setup dbt Cloud CLI's connection to dbt Cloud, only if you haven't already done so (we handled step 1 above and will do step 4 together next).

5. Double check that your `dbt_project.yml` is set up correctly by running `dbt list`. You should get back a list of models and tests in your project.

## Project setup

Once your development platform of choice is set up, use the following steps to get the project ready for whatever you'd like to do with it.

1. Run `task setup`.

#### OR

1. Run `dbt build` to load the sample data into your raw schema, build your models, and test your project.

2. Delete the `jaffle-data` directory now that the raw data is loaded into the warehouse.

Have fun exploring dbt! ðŸŽ‰
